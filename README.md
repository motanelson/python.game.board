2d game board


I'm developing a theory to explain 3D movement in the notion of time to my friends. For this, I chose the theme of a tiger and its hunting territory. The tiger has a hunting territory marked from 0 to f hexadecimal, but the tiger moves in the xy plane. The z is always the same 0 at ground level. It takes 2 hours to travel each sector.
In the first 2 hours, it is in sector 0,0 because it goes to sleep there. It moves to sector 6,6 as it gets thirsty. Every 2 hours, it is in a new sector. If it gets thirsty, it will move to sector 6,6 where there is a watercourse, and to sector 6,a when it is hungry.
